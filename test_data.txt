To test manually the toy robot app just run the toy_robot_app.rb script.

Available commands:
PLACE X,Y,FACING ( place robot to the table with X,Y,FACING position )
RIGHT            ( rotate the robot 90 degrees in the right - change facing )
LEFT             ( rotate the robot 90 degrees in the left - change facing )
REPORT           ( get current robot's position )
MOVE             ( move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing )
EXIT             ( quit console )

Sample scenarios:

1. Get current robot's position.

run: toy_robot_app.rb
type: PLACE 2,2,SOUTH
type: REPORT

output will be: 2,2,SOUTH

2. Robot can move around table surface (We assumed that table have 5 x 5 dimensions). Robot can't go outside the table,
if robot will be on edge of table and tries move outside, the command will be ignored.

run: toy_robot_app.rb
type: PLACE 2,2,SOUTH
type: MOVE
(it moves robot to 2,1,SOUTH coordinates)
type: MOVE
(it moves robot to 2,0,SOUTH coordinates)
type: REPORT
output will be 2,0,SOUTH

type: MOVE
(robot can't fall, so the command will be ignore)
type: REPORT

output will be: 2,0,SOUTH

3. Robot can turn left from current position.

run: toy_robot_app.rb
type: PLACE 2,2,NORTH
type: LEFT
(it changes robot facing from NORTH to WEST)
type: REPORT

output will be: 2,2,WEST

4. Robot can turn right from current position.

run: toy_robot_app.rb
type: PLACE 0,0,WEST
type: RIGHT
(it changes robot facing from WEST to NORTH)
type: REPORT

output will be: 0,0,NORTH

5. It's possible to change place several time.

run: toy_robot_app.rb
type: PLACE 3,3,EAST
type: REPORT

output: 3,3,EAST

type: PLACE 2,1,NORTH
type: REPORT

output: 2,1,NORTH

6. MOVE, RIGHT, LEFT, REPORT commands are only available when user use PLACE X,Y,FACING before.

run: toy_robot_app.rb
type: RIGHT
type: LEFT
type: REPORT
type: MOVE

App will ignore these commands

7. It's impossible to run not allowed commands - app will ignore it.

run: toy_robot_app.rb
type: WHATEVER
type: PLACE -5,20,NORTH (wrong arguments for PLACE command)

In this case robot still will not have any position
